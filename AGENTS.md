# Agent code conventions


## Code conventions
The following code conventions must be followed at all times:
- Do not under any circumstances add comments unless explicitly instructed to do so
- Do not under any circumstances update README files or create new README files unless explicitly instructed to do so
- Do not suffix async methods with `Async` unless there is a synchronous overload
- Ensure that the `Architecture` section in the [README](./README.md) remains up to date when making architectural changes

Use judgement for these code conventions:
- Use primary constructors where appropriate
- Ensure all third-party packages are well supported with recent commit activity prior to adding to to the project
